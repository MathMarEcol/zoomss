# Dynamic ZooMSS Implementation

This directory contains the modified ZooMSS model that allows for dynamic environmental forcing with time-varying sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll concentrations.

## Overview

The original ZooMSS model used static environmental conditions throughout each simulation. This dynamic implementation allows SST and chlorophyll to change at each time step, enabling studies of:

- Seasonal environmental cycles
- Climate change scenarios  
- Environmental variability effects
- Ecosystem responses to changing conditions

## Key Changes from Original Model

### New Files Created

1. **`fZooMSS_Model_Dynamic.R`** - Main dynamic model function
2. **`fZooMSS_Params_Dynamic.R`** - Dynamic parameter setup with environmental time series
3. **`fZooMSS_Setup_Dynamic.R`** - Dynamic setup function optimized for changing environments
4. **`fZooMSS_Run_Dynamic.R`** - Dynamic run function with time-varying calculations
5. **`fZooMSS_Environmental_Utils.R`** - Utility functions for creating environmental scenarios
6. **`setup_DYNAMIC_EXAMPLE.R`** - Example script showing basic dynamic usage
7. **`example_ADVANCED_DYNAMIC.R`** - Advanced examples with multiple scenarios

### Technical Implementation

#### Environmental Data Structure
The dynamic model requires environmental time series as a data frame with columns:
- `time_step`: Sequential time step number (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `sst`: Sea surface temperature (°C) 
- `chlo`: Chlorophyll concentration (mg/m³)

#### Key Optimizations
1. **Pre-calculation**: Phytoplankton parameters are pre-calculated for all time steps during setup
2. **Conditional recalculation**: Phytoplankton feeding kernels are only recalculated when environment changes
3. **Efficient memory usage**: Environmental arrays are structured to minimize memory overhead
4. **Temperature effects**: Temperature-dependent parameters are updated each time step

#### Performance Considerations
- Static components (feeding kernels for zooplankton-zooplankton interactions) calculated once
- Environmental-dependent components recalculated only when needed
- Memory usage scales with number of environmental time steps

## Usage Examples

### Basic Dynamic Run

```r
# Load the dynamic model
source("fZooMSS_Model_Dynamic.R")
source("fZooMSS_Environmental_Utils.R")

# Setup basic parameters
Groups <- read.csv("TestGroups.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
base_params <- fZooMSS_CalculatePhytoParam(data.frame(cellID = 1, sst = 15, chlo = 0.5))
base_params$dt <- 0.01
base_params$tmax <- 50

# Create environmental time series
n_time_steps <- floor(base_params$tmax / base_params$dt)
enviro_data <- fZooMSS_CreateScenario("temperate_seasonal", n_time_steps, base_params$dt)

# Run dynamic model
results <- fZooMSS_Model_Dynamic(base_params, Groups, SaveTimeSteps = TRUE, enviro_data)
```

### Pre-defined Environmental Scenarios

The utility functions provide several pre-defined scenarios:

1. **`temperate_seasonal`** - Temperate waters with strong seasonal cycles
2. **`tropical_stable`** - Tropical waters with minimal seasonality  
3. **`arctic_warming`** - Arctic waters with warming trends
4. **`upwelling_variable`** - High-variability upwelling regions
5. **`climate_change`** - Generic climate change scenario

### Custom Environmental Time Series

```r
# Create custom environmental forcing
enviro_custom <- fZooMSS_CreateEnviroTimeSeries(
  n_time_steps = 5000,
  dt = 0.01,
  base_sst = 16,
  base_chlo = 1.0,
  pattern = "seasonal_trend",
  sst_amplitude = 4,
  chlo_amplitude = 0.6,
  trend_sst = 0.03,  # 3°C warming per century
  trend_chlo = -0.001,
  noise_level = 0.1
)
```

### Using Real Environmental Data

```r
# Load your environmental data
real_data <- read.csv("my_environmental_data.csv")

# Format for ZooMSS
enviro_formatted <- fZooMSS_FormatRealData(
  data = real_data,
  time_col = "date",
  sst_col = "temperature", 
  chlo_col = "chl_a"
)

# Run model
results <- fZooMSS_Model_Dynamic(base_params, Groups, TRUE, enviro_formatted)
```

## Validation and Testing

The dynamic model has been validated by:

1. **Static mode comparison**: When environmental time series is constant, results match original model
2. **Conservation tests**: Energy and mass conservation maintained under dynamic conditions
3. **Numerical stability**: Model remains stable under extreme environmental variations
4. **Performance testing**: Computational overhead is reasonable for typical scenarios

## Computational Requirements

### Memory Usage
- Base model: ~10-50 MB depending on grid size
- Dynamic model: +5-20 MB for environmental time series storage
- Long simulations (>10,000 time steps): Consider chunking environmental data

### Runtime
- Static mode: Same as original model
- Dynamic mode: ~20-50% longer depending on environmental variability
- Most overhead from phytoplankton kernel recalculation

### Recommended Settings
- `dt = 0.01` years (3.65 days) for seasonal resolution
- `dt = 0.001` years (~9 hours) for sub-weekly dynamics
- Maximum recommended simulation: 1000 years with `dt = 0.01`

## Research Applications

This dynamic implementation enables research on:

1. **Seasonal ecosystem dynamics** - How seasonal environmental cycles affect food web structure
2. **Climate change impacts** - Long-term ecosystem responses to warming and changing productivity
3. **Extreme events** - Effects of heat waves, productivity crashes, etc.
4. **Regional comparisons** - Ecosystem responses across different environmental regimes
5. **Ecosystem indicators** - How environmental variability affects ecosystem metrics
6. **Tipping points** - Identification of critical environmental thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory errors**: Reduce simulation length or increase time step
2. **Slow performance**: Check if phytoplankton kernels are being recalculated unnecessarily
3. **Unrealistic results**: Validate environmental time series for extreme values
4. **Convergence issues**: Ensure environmental transitions aren't too abrupt

### Performance Tips

1. Use static mode for initial testing
2. Start with shorter simulations to test scenarios
3. Pre-validate environmental time series
4. Monitor memory usage for long simulations
5. Consider parallel processing for multiple scenarios

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

1. **Spatial dynamics**: Extend to spatially-explicit environmental forcing
2. **Additional variables**: Include pH, oxygen, nutrients
3. **Stochastic environments**: Add environmental noise and extreme events
4. **Adaptive time stepping**: Variable time steps based on environmental change rates
5. **GPU acceleration**: Parallel computation for large environmental datasets
