# Repository Organization Summary

## What We've Done

### 1. Cleaned Up Repository Structure
- **Before**: 40+ loose files scattered in the root directory related to reproduction work
- **After**: Organized into a clean `ReproductionWork/` directory with logical subdirectories

### 2. New Directory Structure

```
ZooMSS/
├── Core Model Files (unchanged)
│   ├── fZooMSS_*.R
│   ├── TestGroups.csv (modified with reproduction column)
│   └── Other original files
├── ReproductionWork/           # NEW - All reproduction-related work
│   ├── Analysis/              # 10 analysis scripts
│   ├── TestScripts/           # 4 test scripts  
│   ├── Documentation/         # 3 documentation files
│   ├── Figures/               # 4 figure directories with all plots
│   ├── Data/                  # 3 data files and backups
│   └── README.md              # Comprehensive documentation
├── DBPM/                      # Organized DBPM reference materials
├── Ancillary/                 # Original ancillary files
├── UserManual/                # Original user manual
└── RawOutput/                 # Model output files
```

### 3. What's Been Organized

**Moved to `/ReproductionWork/Analysis/`:**
- 10 analysis and visualization scripts
- Comprehensive comparison and diagnostic tools
- Progress monitoring utilities

**Moved to `/ReproductionWork/TestScripts/`:**
- 4 test scripts for validating reproduction mechanism
- Diagnostic and performance tests

**Moved to `/ReproductionWork/Documentation/`:**
- Implementation documentation
- Quarto reports
- Performance analysis

**Moved to `/ReproductionWork/Figures/`:**
- 4 complete figure directories
- All reproduction-related plots and visualizations
- Biomass time series figures

**Moved to `/ReproductionWork/Data/`:**
- Analysis results data files
- Original parameter backups
- Diagnostic data

### 4. Files Removed
- Temporary HTML, PDF, and TeX files
- Duplicate and obsolete analysis files
- Session files and temporary plots

### 5. Git Status
- **Before**: 40+ uncommitted files cluttering the workspace
- **After**: Clean commit structure with logical organization
- Core reproduction mechanism changes committed with proper documentation

## Benefits

1. **Easier Navigation**: Core model files are immediately visible
2. **Logical Organization**: Related files grouped by function
3. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive README explains reproduction work
4. **Clean Git History**: Proper commit structure for the reproduction implementation
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between core model and development work

## Ready for Next Steps

The repository is now ready for:
- Further development work
- Collaborative contributions
- Publication preparation
- User documentation updates
