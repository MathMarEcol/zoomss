Description: A functional size-spectrum model of the marine ecosystem that resolves 
    phytoplankton, nine zooplankton functional groups (heterotrophic flagellates and 
    ciliates, omnivorous and carnivorous copepods, larvaceans, euphausiids, salps, 
    chaetognaths and jellyfish) and three size-based fish groups. The model supports 
    both constant and time-varying environmental conditions, enabling studies of 
    seasonal cycles, climate change scenarios, and ecosystem responses to environmental 
    variability. ZooMSS uses the functional size-spectrum framework to resolve 
    body size ranges, size-based feeding characteristics and carbon content of marine 
    functional groups.
