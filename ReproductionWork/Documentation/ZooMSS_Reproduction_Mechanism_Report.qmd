# Executive Summary

The ZooMSS marine ecosystem model has been enhanced with a biologically realistic reproduction mechanism that replaces the traditional "pinning" system. This implementation introduces energy allocation trade-offs between growth and reproduction, maturity-based reproduction, and dynamic recruitment processes. Comprehensive 120-year simulations across environmental gradients demonstrate strong productivity-dependent responses, with substantial ecosystem benefits in mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions.

[The reproduction mechanism shows clear environmental thresholds: struggling in oligotrophic conditions, optimal in mesotrophic environments, and beneficial but with diminishing returns in eutrophic systems.]{.column-margin}

**Key Results:**
- Medium productivity environments show optimal reproduction benefits (+209% fish biomass)
- High productivity environments show enhanced ecosystem stability (+102% total biomass)
- Low productivity environments present challenges for reproduction-based populations (-86% fish biomass)
- Full backward compatibility maintained with existing ZooMSS framework

# Introduction

## Background

The ZooMSS (Zooplankton-Oriented Marine Size Spectrum) model has traditionally used a "pinning" mechanism where fish abundance is artificially set equal to zooplankton abundance to maintain ecosystem balance^[This pinning approach was originally implemented to ensure numerical stability in early versions of the model, but it creates unrealistic population dynamics.]. While computationally stable, this approach lacks biological realism and prevents the model from capturing realistic population dynamics and environmental responses.

## Objectives

This work implements a mechanistic reproduction system that:

1. Replaces artificial pinning with biologically realistic reproduction
2. Introduces energy allocation trade-offs between growth and reproduction
3. Implements maturity-based reproduction thresholds
4. Creates dynamic recruitment to smallest size classes
5. Maintains full backward compatibility with existing ZooMSS framework

# Model Implementation

## Reproduction Toggle System

The reproduction mechanism is controlled by a new `Reproduction` column in the group parameter files:

- `Reproduction = 1`: Enable reproduction mechanism (typically for fish groups)
- `Reproduction = 0`: Disable reproduction, use traditional pinning (typically for zooplankton)

This allows selective application of reproduction to appropriate functional groups while maintaining existing dynamics for others.

## Energy Allocation Framework

### Maturity Function

The reproduction mechanism uses a sigmoidal maturity function based on body size relative to maturation size ($W_{mat}$):

::: column-margin
The steepness parameter of 5 creates a sharp transition from juvenile to adult reproductive capacity, mimicking natural maturation patterns observed in marine fish populations.
:::

$$M(w) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-5(\log_{10}(w) - W_{mat})}}$$

where:
- $w$ = individual body weight (g)
- $W_{mat}$ = maturation weight (log₁₀ g)
- $M(w)$ = maturity fraction (0 to 1)

### Energy Allocation

For mature individuals, available energy is split between growth and reproduction:

$$f_{repro}(w) = 0.3 \times M(w)$$
$$f_{growth}(w) = 1 - f_{repro}(w)$$

[The 30% allocation to reproduction represents a biologically realistic trade-off, consistent with empirical studies of fish energy budgets in marine ecosystems.]{.column-margin}

where:
- $f_{repro}(w)$ = fraction of energy allocated to reproduction
- $f_{growth}(w)$ = fraction of energy allocated to growth
- 0.3 = reproduction allocation parameter (30% for fully mature individuals)

### Modified Growth Equation

The original ZooMSS growth equation is modified to account for energy allocation:

$$\frac{\partial N(w,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial w}[f_{growth}(w) \times g(w) \times N(w,t)] + \text{other terms}$$

where:
- $N(w,t)$ = abundance at weight $w$ and time $t$
- $g(w)$ = original growth rate
- $f_{growth}(w)$ = growth energy fraction

## Reproduction Calculations

### Reproduction Rate

The reproduction rate for each size class is calculated as:

$$R(w,t) = f_{repro}(w) \times \frac{g(w) \times N(w,t)}{w}$$

where:
- $R(w,t)$ = reproduction rate (individuals per unit time)
- $g(w)$ = net growth efficiency
- $N(w,t)$ = abundance at size $w$

### Total Reproduction Biomass

The total biomass available for reproduction is:

$$B_{repro}(t) = \sum_{w} R(w,t) \times w \times \Delta w$$

where $\Delta w$ is the size class width.

### Recruitment Calculation

New recruits are added to the smallest size classes:

$$\text{Recruitment Rate} = \frac{B_{repro}(t)}{w_{min} \times \Delta w}$$

where $w_{min}$ is the minimum body weight in the size spectrum.

## Conditional Pinning Logic

The model implements conditional pinning based on the reproduction status:

```r
if (reproduction_on) {
  # Apply reproduction mechanism
  # No fish pinning
} else {
  # Apply traditional pinning
  # Fish abundance = Zooplankton abundance
}
```

This ensures backward compatibility while enabling the new reproduction dynamics when activated.

# Simulation Framework

## Model Versions Tested

Three model configurations were compared:

1. **Old ZooMSS**: Traditional pinning mechanism for all groups
2. **New ZooMSS (Reproduction OFF)**: New framework with reproduction disabled
3. **New ZooMSS (Reproduction ON)**: New framework with reproduction enabled for fish

## Environmental Scenarios

Three chlorophyll-a scenarios representing different productivity levels:

| Scenario | Phytoplankton Intercept | Productivity Level | Description |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Low | -4 | Oligotrophic | Low chlorophyll-a, nutrient-poor |
| Medium | -3 | Mesotrophic | Moderate chlorophyll-a, intermediate nutrients |
| High | -2 | Eutrophic | High chlorophyll-a, nutrient-rich |

## Simulation Parameters

## Community Biomass Time Series

The following figures show total community biomass over the 120-year simulation period for each environmental scenario.

### Low Chlorophyll Scenario

![Total Community Biomass - Low Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/low_community.png){fig-column="margin" width="100%"}

[In oligotrophic conditions, the reproduction mechanism struggles to maintain fish populations. The reproduction-enabled model shows substantially lower total biomass (-35%) compared to the traditional pinning approach.]{.column-margin}

This suggests that in nutrient-poor environments, the energy costs of reproduction may exceed the benefits, leading to population declines.

### Medium Chlorophyll Scenario

![Total Community Biomass - Medium Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/medium_community.png){width="100%"}

**Interpretation**: Mesotrophic conditions provide optimal conditions for the reproduction mechanism. The reproduction-enabled model shows dramatic increases in total community biomass (+281%) compared to traditional pinning. This represents the "sweet spot" where sufficient energy is available for both growth and reproduction, leading to enhanced ecosystem productivity.

### High Chlorophyll Scenario

![Total Community Biomass - High Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/high_community.png){fig-column="page-right" width="100%"}

[In eutrophic conditions, the reproduction mechanism provides moderate benefits (+102% total biomass). The relative improvement is less than in medium productivity environments, suggesting potential saturation effects.]{.column-margin}

## Fish vs Zooplankton Dynamics

### Trophic Structure Changes

![Fish vs Zooplankton - Low Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/low_fish_zoo.png){fig-column="margin" width="100%"}

![Fish vs Zooplankton - Medium Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/medium_fish_zoo.png){width="100%"}

![Fish vs Zooplankton - High Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/high_fish_zoo.png){fig-column="margin" width="100%"}

[The reproduction mechanism fundamentally alters trophic structure. In productive environments, both fish and zooplankton biomass increase, but zooplankton show larger relative increases, leading to more balanced ecosystems.]{.column-margin}

In low productivity environments, both trophic levels decline, but fish are more severely affected due to the energetic costs of reproduction.

### Fish:Zooplankton Ratios

![Fish:Zooplankton Ratio - Low Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/low_ratio.png){fig-column="margin" width="100%"}

![Fish:Zooplankton Ratio - Medium Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/medium_ratio.png){width="100%"}

![Fish:Zooplankton Ratio - High Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/high_ratio.png){fig-column="margin" width="100%"}

[Traditional pinning maintains artificially high fish:zooplankton ratios (>1.0), while reproduction creates more realistic ratios (~0.5), suggesting improved ecosystem balance.]{.column-margin}

The reproduction mechanism consistently creates more balanced fish:zooplankton ratios across all scenarios, leading to more sustainable trophic structure.

## Functional Group Responses

### Fish Groups

![Fish Groups - Low Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/low_fish_groups.png)

![Fish Groups - Medium Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/medium_fish_groups.png)

![Fish Groups - High Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/high_fish_groups.png)

**Interpretation**: Individual fish groups show varied responses to the reproduction mechanism. Small fish groups generally benefit more than large fish groups, consistent with the recruitment focus on smallest size classes. The reproduction mechanism creates more realistic size-structured dynamics, with clear differences between model versions most apparent in medium and high productivity scenarios.

### Zooplankton Groups

![Zooplankton Groups - Low Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/low_zoo_groups.png)

![Zooplankton Groups - Medium Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/medium_zoo_groups.png)

![Zooplankton Groups - High Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/high_zoo_groups.png)

**Interpretation**: Zooplankton groups show indirect responses to fish reproduction changes. In productive environments, reduced fish predation pressure (due to more balanced fish:zooplankton ratios) allows zooplankton populations to increase. Different zooplankton functional groups show varied responses, with some groups benefiting more than others from the altered predation regime.

## Equilibrium Analysis

### Community-Level Equilibrium

![Equilibrium Community Biomass](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/equilibrium_community.png){fig-column="page-right" width="100%"}

[Final equilibrium biomass clearly demonstrates the environmental dependency of reproduction benefits. The pattern is consistent across the 120-year simulation period.]{.column-margin}

The reproduction mechanism provides substantial benefits in medium and high productivity environments but challenges in low productivity conditions.

### Fish vs Zooplankton Equilibrium

![Equilibrium Fish vs Zooplankton](ZooMSS_Biomass_TimeSeries/equilibrium_fish_zoo.png){width="100%"}

::: column-margin
Equilibrium analysis reveals that the reproduction mechanism affects fish and zooplankton differently across productivity gradients. In productive environments, both groups benefit, but zooplankton show larger relative increases.
:::

In low productivity environments, both groups decline, but fish are more severely affected, highlighting the energy costs of reproduction.

## Growth Rate Analysis

The reproduction mechanism fundamentally alters growth patterns through energy allocation trade-offs. The following analysis examines how energy allocation to reproduction affects growth rates across different size classes and environmental conditions.

### Growth Rate Patterns Across Scenarios

![Growth Rates - Low Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Reproduction_Figures_Fixed/growth_rates_low.png){width="100%"}

**Low Productivity Environment**: In oligotrophic conditions, growth rates show minimal differences between model versions for most groups. The reproduction mechanism has limited impact because energy availability is constrained, and reproduction rates remain low across all size classes.

![Growth Rates - Medium Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Reproduction_Figures_Fixed/growth_rates_medium.png){width="100%"}

**Medium Productivity Environment**: This scenario reveals the clearest growth rate modifications due to reproduction. Fish groups show reduced growth rates in larger size classes where reproduction is active, demonstrating the energy allocation trade-off between growth and reproduction.

![Growth Rates - High Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Reproduction_Figures_Fixed/growth_rates_high.png){width="100%"}

**High Productivity Environment**: In eutrophic conditions, the reproduction mechanism creates distinct growth rate patterns. The abundant energy allows for both growth and reproduction, but the trade-off is still evident in mature size classes.

### Key Growth Rate Insights

[The growth rate analysis reveals that reproduction creates realistic life-history trade-offs, with mature individuals showing reduced growth rates due to energy allocation to reproduction.]{.column-margin}

1. **Size-Dependent Effects**: Growth rate modifications are most pronounced in larger size classes where fish reach maturity
2. **Environmental Modulation**: The magnitude of growth rate changes varies with environmental productivity
3. **Species-Specific Responses**: Different fish groups show varied responses based on their maturation sizes and life-history parameters
4. **Energy Conservation**: Total energy allocation (growth + reproduction) remains consistent with the original model's energy budget

## Reproductive Allocation Analysis

The reproductive allocation patterns demonstrate the maturity-dependent energy allocation mechanism that drives the reproduction system. This analysis examines how energy is allocated to reproduction across size classes and environmental gradients.

### Reproductive Allocation Patterns

![Reproduction Allocation - Low Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Reproduction_Figures_Corrected/reproduction_allocation_low.png){fig-column="margin" width="100%"}

[In low productivity environments, reproductive allocation remains minimal across all size classes, reflecting the energy constraints that limit reproduction success.]{.column-margin}

**Low Productivity**: Reproductive allocation shows flat patterns near zero, indicating that energy constraints prevent significant reproductive investment even in mature individuals.

![Reproduction Allocation - Medium Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Reproduction_Figures_Corrected/reproduction_allocation_medium.png){width="100%"}

**Medium Productivity**: This scenario shows clear reproductive allocation patterns, with sigmoidal increases at maturity sizes (indicated by dashed vertical lines). The updated figures demonstrate the energy allocation to reproduction increasing after individuals reach maturity.

![Reproduction Allocation - High Chlorophyll](ZooMSS_Reproduction_Figures_Corrected/reproduction_allocation_high.png){fig-column="margin" width="100%"}

**High Productivity**: In eutrophic conditions, the figures reveal strong reproductive allocation patterns with pronounced sigmoidal curves, showing substantial energy investment in reproduction for mature individuals.

### Expected Reproductive Allocation Patterns

[The reproductive allocation should follow a sigmoidal pattern based on the maturity function: $f_{repro}(w) = 0.3 \times \frac{1}{1 + e^{-5(\log_{10}(w) - W_{mat})}}$]{.column-margin}

Based on the theoretical framework, the reproductive allocation should exhibit:

1. **Maturity Thresholds**: Sharp increases in reproductive allocation at species-specific maturation sizes
2. **Maximum Allocation**: Up to 30% of available energy allocated to reproduction in fully mature individuals
3. **Environmental Sensitivity**: Higher absolute reproductive rates in more productive environments
4. **Species Differences**: Varied patterns based on different maturation sizes across fish groups

### Key Patterns and Insights

The corrected reproductive allocation figures demonstrate several important biological patterns:

1. **Maturity Thresholds**: The figures clearly show the onset of reproductive allocation at species-specific maturation sizes
2. **Size-Dependent Allocation**: Larger individuals allocate progressively more energy to reproduction
3. **Environmental Sensitivity**: Higher productivity environments support greater reproductive investment
4. **Species-Specific Patterns**: Different fish groups show varied reproductive strategies based on their life histories

# Discussion

## Biological Realism Enhancements

The reproduction mechanism introduces several key biological realism improvements:

### Energy Trade-offs

[This energy allocation mirrors the fundamental trade-off observed in natural fish populations, where reproductive investment comes at the cost of somatic growth.]{.column-margin}

The 70%/30% split between growth and reproduction energy creates realistic life-history trade-offs. Mature individuals must allocate energy between maintaining themselves (growth) and producing offspring (reproduction), reflecting fundamental biological constraints.

### Size-Dependent Maturity
The sigmoidal maturity function ensures that reproduction only occurs after individuals reach appropriate size thresholds. This prevents unrealistic reproduction by juveniles and creates more realistic population structure.

### Recruitment Dynamics
By focusing recruitment on the smallest size classes, the model creates realistic population replenishment patterns. This contrasts with artificial pinning, which maintains abundance across all size classes simultaneously.

## Environmental Responsiveness

### Productivity Thresholds

::: column-margin
These thresholds reflect real marine ecosystems where reproduction success is tightly coupled to environmental conditions and resource availability.
:::

The results reveal clear productivity thresholds for reproduction success:

- **Below threshold** (low productivity): Reproduction costs exceed benefits
- **At threshold** (medium productivity): Optimal reproduction benefits
- **Above threshold** (high productivity): Diminishing returns but still beneficial

### Ecosystem Feedback
The reproduction mechanism creates realistic ecosystem feedback loops:

- Successful reproduction increases fish abundance
- Increased fish abundance affects zooplankton through predation
- Zooplankton changes feedback to affect fish growth and reproduction
- Environmental conditions modulate all these interactions

## Model Framework Advantages

### Backward Compatibility
The toggle system ensures that existing ZooMSS applications continue to work unchanged. Users can selectively enable reproduction for specific studies while maintaining traditional approaches for others.

### Computational Stability
All 120-year simulations completed successfully without numerical instabilities, demonstrating the robustness of the implementation.

### Parameter Preservation
All original biological parameters remain unchanged, ensuring that the reproduction mechanism builds upon established, validated parameter sets.

# Implications and Applications

## Fisheries Management

The reproduction mechanism provides several advantages for fisheries applications:

### Realistic Population Dynamics
Fish populations respond to environmental conditions through reproduction success, providing more realistic projections of stock dynamics under varying environmental conditions.

### Size Structure Modeling
The focus on recruitment to smallest size classes creates realistic size structure evolution, important for understanding fishing impacts on different size classes.

### Environmental Dependency
Reproduction success varies with ecosystem productivity, enabling assessment of environmental effects on fish population sustainability.

## Climate Change Research

### Productivity Shifts
The strong environmental dependency makes the model suitable for studying climate-driven changes in ocean productivity and their effects on marine ecosystems.

### Threshold Identification
The clear productivity thresholds help identify critical environmental conditions for ecosystem sustainability under climate change.

### Ecosystem Responses
The community-level responses provide insights into how entire ecosystems might respond to environmental changes, not just individual species.

## Conservation Biology

### Population Viability
The reproduction mechanism provides more realistic assessments of population viability under different environmental scenarios.

### Habitat Quality
The link between environmental conditions and reproduction success helps quantify habitat quality effects on population sustainability.

### Ecosystem Services
The community-level responses help assess how environmental changes might affect ecosystem services provided by marine systems.

# Technical Validation

## Model Verification

### Mass Balance
Energy conservation is maintained throughout the reproduction calculations:
- Energy allocated to reproduction is removed from growth
- Reproduction energy is converted to new recruits
- Total system energy remains conserved

### Numerical Stability
All simulations completed successfully over 120-year periods without:
- Numerical overflow or underflow
- Population crashes due to numerical artifacts
- Unrealistic oscillations or instabilities

### Backward Compatibility
Verification that Old ZooMSS and New ZooMSS (reproduction OFF) produce identical results confirms successful implementation without breaking existing functionality.

## Biological Validation

### Realistic Responses
The model produces biologically reasonable responses:
- Reproduction increases with body size (maturity function)
- Energy trade-offs create realistic life-history patterns
- Environmental dependency matches ecological expectations

### Size Spectrum Maintenance
The reproduction mechanism maintains realistic size spectrum slopes and patterns, consistent with marine ecosystem observations.

# Future Developments

## Immediate Enhancements

### Temperature Coupling
Link reproduction success to temperature gradients:
$$f_{repro}(w,T) = 0.3 \times M(w) \times T_{effect}(T)$$

where $T_{effect}(T)$ modulates reproduction based on temperature.

### Seasonal Cycles
Implement seasonal reproduction patterns:
$$R(w,t) = f_{repro}(w) \times S(t) \times \frac{g(w) \times N(w,t)}{w}$$

where $S(t)$ represents seasonal reproduction timing.

## Advanced Features

### Environmental Stochasticity
Add environmental variability to reproduction success:
$$f_{repro}(w,t) = 0.3 \times M(w) \times (1 + \sigma \times \epsilon(t))$$

where $\epsilon(t)$ is environmental noise and $\sigma$ is variability magnitude.

### Density Dependence
Implement density-dependent reproduction:
$$f_{repro}(w,N) = 0.3 \times M(w) \times D(N_{total})$$

where $D(N_{total})$ reduces reproduction at high population densities.
