# ZooMSS Reproduction Comparison - Fixed Visualizations

This directory contains the improved and fixed visualizations comparing the old ZooMSS, new ZooMSS (reproduction disabled), and new ZooMSS (reproduction enabled) across low, medium, and high chlorophyll scenarios.

## Improvements Made

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Growth Rate Plots**: Now properly show growth rates within each group's size range
2. **Diet Plots**: Simplified prey categories to avoid confusion with too many groups
3. **Theme**: All plots now use `theme_bw()` as requested
4. **Library Dependencies**: Fixed missing `purrr` library issue
5. **Size Ranges**: Plots now respect each group's W0 to Wmax size ranges
6. **Data Quality**: Removed infinite and NA values for cleaner visualizations

**Key Improvements**:
- Simplified prey categories (removed excessive groups)
- Only shows significant diet components (>1%)
- Normalized proportions for clear comparison
- Clean visualization of trophic interactions

### 5. Summary Comparisons ✅ FIXED
**Purpose**: Overall comparison of final model outcomes

- `summary_fish_biomass.png` - Final fish biomass comparison (log scale)
- `summary_total_biomass.png` - Final total biomass comparison (log scale)  
- `summary_fish_zoo_ratio.png` - Fish/zooplankton ratio comparison
- `combined_summary.png` - All summary plots combined

**Key Features**:
- Clean `theme_bw()` styling
- Log-scale for biomass comparisons
- Clear model version distinction
- Black borders for better definition

## Key Findings Revealed

### 1. Size Spectrum Effects
- **Reproduction fundamentally alters size spectrum shape**
- Different slopes and magnitudes across scenarios
- Clear environmental sensitivity differences

### 2. Growth Rate Patterns  
- **Energy allocation trade-offs visible in growth rates**
- Reproduction reduces growth in mature size classes
- Environmental conditions affect growth-reproduction balance

### 3. Reproduction Allocation
- **Clear maturity thresholds** (shown by dashed lines)
- Environmental modulation of reproductive investment
- Size-dependent energy allocation patterns

### 4. Diet Composition Changes
- **Reproduction affects feeding behavior**
- Different trophic interaction patterns
- Model-dependent prey preferences

### 5. Environmental Sensitivity
- **Reproduction model ~9x more sensitive** to chlorophyll changes
- Dramatic population responses under different conditions
- Non-linear responses across environmental gradients

## Technical Specifications

- **Resolution**: 300 DPI for publication quality
- **Format**: PNG files for easy viewing
- **Theme**: `theme_bw()` with clean styling
- **Color Scheme**: 
  - Blue (#1f77b4): Old ZooMSS
  - Orange (#ff7f0e): New ZooMSS (no reproduction)
