\usage{
zoomss_run(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model object created by zoomss_setup containing:
\itemize{
\item param: Complete parameter list with environmental time series
\item Feeding kernels and biological rate parameters
\item Initial conditions and model structure
}}
}
\value{
List containing complete model output:
\itemize{
\item param: Model parameters used in simulation
\item N: Abundance time series (time x groups x size classes)
\item gg: Growth rate time series
\item diet: Diet composition time series
\item Z: Mortality rate time series
\item w: Size class weights (g)
\item Additional time series if SaveTimeSteps enabled

\description{
Runs the ZooMSS model forward in time, updating environmental conditions
and population dynamics at each time step using the McKendrick-von Foerster framework.

\details{
Run ZooMSS Model Forward in Time

This is the core simulation engine of ZooMSS that:

\strong{Environmental Dynamics:}
\itemize{
\item Updates phytoplankton abundance spectrum based on chlorophyll time series
\item Applies temperature effects on zooplankton and fish metabolism
\item Recalculates feeding kernels with current environmental conditions
}

\strong{Population Dynamics:}
\itemize{
\item Solves McKendrick-von Foerster equation for size-structured growth
\item Updates feeding interactions between all size classes and groups
\item Calculates mortality from predation, senescence, and fishing
\item Handles recruitment and boundary conditions for each functional group
}

\strong{Time Integration:}
\itemize{
\item Processes model through all time steps with adaptive environmental forcing
\item Saves output at specified intervals for memory efficiency
\item Maintains mass balance and numerical stability throughout simulation
}

Unlike static models, this version dynamically updates phytoplankton spectra
and temperature effects at each time step based on provided environmental data.
