\title{Combine ZooMSS outputs from multiple spatial cells}
\usage{
fZooMSS_MergeMultipleCells()
}
\value{
NULL (function saves files directly to disk)
}
\description{
This function merges ZooMSS model outputs from multiple spatial cells
(grid cells) into single consolidated datasets for analysis and visualization.
}
\details{
Merge Multiple Cell Outputs from ZooMSS Runs

When running ZooMSS across multiple spatial locations (e.g., different
ocean grid cells), this function combines the individual cell outputs into
unified datasets. The function:
\itemize{
\item Loads all RDS files from the "RawOutput" directory
\item Extracts abundances, growth rates, and diet data from each cell
\item Combines them into lists where each element represents one spatial cell
\item Saves the merged results in various formats (RDS and RData)
\item Preserves the model parameters from the first cell (assumed identical across cells)
}

This is essential for spatial ZooMSS analyses where the model is run
independently for multiple locations and the results need to be combined
for regional or global analysis.
}
\note{
This function assumes:
\itemize{
\item All individual cell outputs are stored as RDS files in "RawOutput/" directory
\item All cells used identical model parameters
\item Output directory "Output/" exists or can be created
\item The function is run from the directory containing "RawOutput/" subdirectory
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Typically run after completing multiple ZooMSS cell runs
fZooMSS_MergeMultipleCells()

# The function will create files like:
# "Output/model_[run_name].RDS"
# "Output/res_[run_name].RDS" 
# "Output/growth_[run_name].RDS"
# "Output/diets_[run_name].RDS"
# "Output/full_[run_name].RData"
}
