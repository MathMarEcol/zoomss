\title{Merge ZooMSS output with environmental data for spatial analysis}
\usage{
zAddEnviro(Zoo, venviro)
}
\arguments{
\item{Zoo}{ZooMSS results tibble (typically from zConvert2Tibble)}

\item{venviro}{Environmental data frame with cell-specific environmental variables}
}
\value{
Tibble combining ZooMSS results with environmental data
}
\description{
Adds environmental forcing data to ZooMSS results based on spatial
cell IDs for integrated ecological analysis.
}
\details{
Add Environmental Data to ZooMSS Results

This function joins ZooMSS biological output with environmental data
including chlorophyll, temperature, phytoplankton parameters, and geographic
coordinates. Essential for analyzing relationships between environmental
forcing and biological responses in spatial ZooMSS applications.
