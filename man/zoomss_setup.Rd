\details{
Setup ZooMSS Model Structure and Feeding Kernels

This function initializes the core ZooMSS model structure by calculating:

\strong{Static Components (calculated once):}
\itemize{
\item Feeding preference kernels based on predator-prey size ratios
\item Search volumes and encounter rates between size classes
\item Baseline mortality rates (senescence, fishing)
\item Initial abundance distributions for all functional groups
}

\strong{Dynamic Component Structures (updated during run):}
\itemize{
\item Phytoplankton feeding kernels (structure calculated here, values updated with environment)
\item Growth and diffusion kernels for zooplankton and fish interactions
\item Diet and mortality tracking arrays
}

\strong{Model Architecture:}
\itemize{
\item Size-structured populations across logarithmic size classes
\item Multiple functional groups with different feeding behaviors
\item Environmental coupling through phytoplankton and temperature
}

The function separates static calculations (done once for efficiency) from
dynamic calculations (updated each time step in zoomss_run).
