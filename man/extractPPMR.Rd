\usage{
extractPPMR(mdl)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS results object containing abundance data (N) and model parameters}
}
\value{
For 2D input: List containing PPMR density data and species-specific values for plotting
For 3D input: Array where first dimension is time, containing PPMR results for each timestep
}
\description{
Calculates predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) values and biomass weightings
for creating PPMR distribution plots in ZooMSS analysis.

\details{
Calculate PPMR Data for Plotting

This function computes theoretical and realized PPMR patterns by:
\itemize{
\item Calculating size-dependent PPMR values using Wirtz 2012 equations
\item Weighting by biomass to show community-level patterns
\item Computing species-specific PPMR values
\item Handling special cases for filter feeders (larvaceans, salps)
\item Processing either time-averaged abundances (2D) or full time series (3D)
}

The function dynamically determines size class ranges for larvaceans and salps
based on their W0 and Wmax values. For 3D abundance arrays, it calculates
PPMR for each time step separately.

This is a helper function primarily used by plotPPMR for visualization.
PPMR analysis provides insights into food web structure and predation patterns.
