\usage{
fZooMSS_Plot_BiomassTimeSeries(
  dat,
  stacked = FALSE,
  proportional = FALSE,
  species = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs with time series data}

\item{stacked}{Logical, whether to create stacked area plot instead of line plot (default: FALSE)}

\item{proportional}{Logical, whether to show proportions instead of absolute values (default: FALSE)}

\item{species}{Character vector of species names to include in plot. If NULL, all species included (default: NULL)}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing biomass time series by species
}
\description{
Creates flexible time series plots showing how total biomass of functional
groups changes throughout the ZooMSS simulation, with options for line plots,
stacked area plots, and proportional displays.

\details{
Plot Biomass Time Series

This function creates biomass time series visualization with multiple options:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Line plots}: Individual species biomass trajectories over time
\item \strong{Stacked plots}: Cumulative biomass showing total ecosystem biomass
\item \strong{Proportional plots}: Relative biomass contributions (0-1 scale)
\item \strong{Species filtering}: Focus on specific functional groups
}

The function calculates biomass by multiplying abundance by body weights and
summing across size classes for each functional group. Different plot types help
visualize different aspects of ecosystem dynamics:
\itemize{
\item Line plots show individual group patterns and relative magnitudes
\item Stacked plots show total ecosystem biomass and contributions
\item Proportional plots highlight shifts in community composition
}
}

\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model with SaveTimeSteps = TRUE
results <- fZooMSS_Model(input_params, Groups, SaveTimeSteps = TRUE)

# Basic line plot of all species
biomass_plot <- fZooMSS_Plot_BiomassTimeSeries(results)

# Stacked area plot showing total biomass
stacked_plot <- fZooMSS_Plot_BiomassTimeSeries(results, stacked = TRUE)

# Proportional plot showing relative contributions
prop_plot <- fZooMSS_Plot_BiomassTimeSeries(results, proportional = TRUE)

# Focus on specific groups
