\title{Visualize predator-prey mass ratio patterns in ZooMSS results}
\usage{
plotPPMR(mdl, idx)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs and parameters}

\item{idx}{The time index to plot}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing PPMR distribution with species-specific overlays
}
\description{
Creates a plot showing the distribution of predator-prey mass ratios (PPMR)
across functional groups, providing insights into the trophic structure of the ecosystem.
}
\details{
Plot Predator-Prey Mass Ratio (PPMR)

This function calculates and visualizes PPMR patterns by:
\itemize{
\item Computing theoretical PPMR values for each functional group and size class
\item Weighting by biomass to show realized community patterns
\item Creating a density plot of PPMR distribution across the community
\item Overlaying species-specific PPMR values as points
}

PPMR is a key ecological metric that describes the size relationship between
predators and their prey, providing insight into food web structure and
energy transfer efficiency in marine ecosystems.
