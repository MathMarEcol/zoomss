\title{Compute trophic levels for functional groups using diet composition}
\usage{
fZooMSS_TrophicLevel(diet_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{diet_matrix}{12x15 matrix where rows are predators (functional groups) and
columns are prey (first 3 columns are phytoplankton size classes, remaining 12 are
zooplankton/fish groups). Values represent diet fractions.}
}
\value{
Vector of trophic levels for each functional group (length 12)
}
\description{
Calculates trophic levels for each functional group based on their
diet composition using an iterative Gauss-Seidel algorithm.
}
\details{
Calculate Trophic Levels from Diet Matrix

This function computes trophic levels by:
\itemize{
\item Starting with phytoplankton at trophic level 1.0
\item Initializing all other groups at trophic level 2.0
\item Iteratively updating trophic levels based on weighted diet composition
\item Continuing until convergence (difference < 0.01) or maximum iterations (100)
}

Trophic level calculation follows: TL = 1 + Σ(diet_fraction_i × TL_prey_i)

This provides a quantitative measure of each group's position in the food web
and is useful for analyzing ecosystem structure and energy transfer efficiency.
