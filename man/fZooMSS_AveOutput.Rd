\title{Calculate mean of final portion of ZooMSS time series}
\usage{
fZooMSS_AveOutput(x, prop = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{3D array with dimensions (time, groups, size_classes)}

\item{prop}{Proportion of final time series to average (default: 0.5)}
}
\value{
2D array with averaged values (groups x size_classes)
}
\description{
Calculates the mean of the final portion (default 50\%) of a time series
to obtain equilibrium values after model spin-up period.
}
\details{
Calculate Average Output from Model Time Series

This function removes the initial transient period from time series data
and calculates the mean of the remaining portion, providing representative
steady-state values. Essential for obtaining equilibrium abundances, growth rates,
and other model outputs after the model has reached dynamic equilibrium.
