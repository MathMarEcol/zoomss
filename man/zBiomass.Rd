\title{Convert ZooMSS abundance matrices to biomass by multiplying by body weights}
\usage{
zBiomass(res, vmdl)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{List of abundance matrices from ZooMSS output}

\item{vmdl}{ZooMSS model object containing weight vector (param$w)}
}
\value{
List of biomass matrices in grams wet weight
}
\description{
Converts abundance data to wet weight biomass by multiplying abundances
by the corresponding body weights for each size class.

\details{
Convert Abundance to Biomass

This function transforms abundance matrices to biomass by applying the
weight vector across size classes. Essential for analyses requiring biomass
units rather than abundance counts.
