}
\arguments{
\item{x}{3D array outptut from ZooMSS model}

\item{method}{Character string specifying aggregation method: "sum" (default) or "mean".}
}

}
\description{
Calculates total abundance across all functional groups and size classes using the specified method.
}
\details{
Aggregate abundances across all groups and size classes

This function provides the most aggregated view of ZooMSS output by applying the method across both functional groups and size classes.
