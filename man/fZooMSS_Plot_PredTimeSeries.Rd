\title{Visualize predation mortality changes over time for each functional group}
\usage{
fZooMSS_Plot_PredTimeSeries(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs with time series data}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing predation mortality time series by species
}
\description{
Creates time series plots showing how average predation mortality rates of each
functional group change throughout the ZooMSS simulation period.

\details{
Plot Predation Mortality Time Series

This function creates predation mortality time series by:
\itemize{
\item Averaging predation mortality rates across all size classes for each functional group
\item Converting to long format for ggplot visualization
\item Plotting mortality rates over time without log transformation
\item Using species-specific colors and filtering out zero values
}

Predation mortality time series help assess:
\itemize{
\item Predation pressure on different functional groups over time
\item Seasonal or temporal patterns in predation intensity
\item Relative vulnerability of functional groups to predation
\item Model dynamics and predator-prey interactions
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model with SaveTimeSteps = TRUE
results <- fZooMSS_Model(input_params, Groups, SaveTimeSteps = TRUE)
mortality_plot <- fZooMSS_Plot_PredTimeSeries(results)
print(mortality_plot)
}
