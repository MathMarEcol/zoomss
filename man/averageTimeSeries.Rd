\title{Calculate mean of final portion of ZooMSS time series}
\usage{
averageTimeSeries(mdl, var, n_years = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS model results object containing model parameters and output arrays}

\item{var}{Character string specifying which variable to extract and average (e.g., "N", "Growth", "Mort")}

\item{n_years}{Number of years from the end of the time series to average (default: 10)}
}
\value{
2D array with averaged values (groups x size_classes)
}
\description{
Calculates the mean of the final n years of a time series
to obtain equilibrium values after model spin-up period.
}
\details{
Calculate Average Output from Model Time Series

This function removes the initial transient period from time series data
and calculates the mean of the final n years, providing representative
steady-state values. Essential for obtaining equilibrium abundances, growth rates,
and other model outputs after the model has reached dynamic equilibrium.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run ZooMSS model
results <- zoomss_model(input_params, Groups)

# Average final 3 years of abundance data
avg_abundance <- averageTimeSeries(results, "N", n_years = 3)

# Average final 10 years of growth data (default)
avg_growth <- averageTimeSeries(results, "gg")
}
