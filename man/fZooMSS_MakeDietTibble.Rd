\title{Convert diet matrix to long format for analysis and visualization}
\usage{
fZooMSS_MakeDietTibble(mat, mdl)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Diet matrix from ZooMSS output (predators x prey)}

\item{mdl}{ZooMSS model object containing species names for labeling}
}
\value{
Long tibble with columns: Predator, Prey, Diet
}
\description{
Converts ZooMSS diet matrix from wide format to long (tidy) format
with predator-prey relationships clearly defined.
}
\details{
Create Diet Matrix in Long Tibble Format

This function transforms diet matrices into a long format suitable for
analysis and visualization of feeding relationships. The resulting tibble
contains predator-prey pairs with diet fraction values, making it easy to
analyze trophic interactions and create food web visualizations.
