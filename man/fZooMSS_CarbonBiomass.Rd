\title{Convert ZooMSS abundances to carbon biomass across all size classes}
\usage{
fZooMSS_CarbonBiomass(res, vmdl)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{List of abundance matrices from ZooMSS output}

\item{vmdl}{ZooMSS model object containing weight vector and carbon content factors}
}
\value{
List of carbon biomass matrices (grams carbon)
}
\description{
Converts abundance data to carbon biomass by multiplying by body weights
and then by carbon content factors for each functional group.
}
\details{
Convert Abundance to Carbon Biomass

This function performs a two-step conversion:
\enumerate{
\item Abundance to wet weight biomass (using body weights)
\item Wet weight to carbon biomass (using group-specific carbon content)
}

Carbon biomass is essential for biogeochemical analyses and comparisons
with field data that are often reported in carbon units.
