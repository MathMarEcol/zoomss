\title{Calculate predator-prey mass ratio data for visualization}
\usage{
PPMR_plot(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{ZooMSS results object containing abundances and model parameters}
}
\value{
List containing PPMR density data and species-specific values for plotting
}
\description{
Calculates predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) values and biomass weightings
for creating PPMR distribution plots in ZooMSS analysis.

\details{
Calculate PPMR Data for Plotting

This function computes theoretical and realized PPMR patterns by:
\itemize{
\item Calculating size-dependent PPMR values using Wirtz 2012 equations
\item Weighting by biomass to show community-level patterns
\item Computing species-specific PPMR values
\item Handling special cases for filter feeders (larvaceans, salps)
}

This is a helper function primarily used by zPlot_PPMR for visualization.
PPMR analysis provides insights into food web structure and predation patterns.
