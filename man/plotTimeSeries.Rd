\title{Unified function to visualize time series changes for different metrics}
\usage{
plotTimeSeries(
  mdl,
  by = "abundance",
  type = "line",
  transform = "identity",
  species = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs with time series data}

\item{by}{Character string specifying the metric to plot. Options: "abundance", "biomass", "mortality", "growth" (default: "abundance")}

\item{type}{Character vector of plot type. Use \code{line} for the default line plot, \code{stack} or \code{fill} (as per geom_area) for stacked or proportional plots. (default: "line")}

\item{transform}{Character vector of the required y-axis transformation. Options from \verb{scale_*_continuous} (Default: "identity).}

\item{species}{Character vector of species names to include. If NULL, all species included (default: NULL, applies to all metrics)}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing the requested time series by species
}
\description{
Creates time series plots showing how abundance, biomass, mortality, or growth
rates of functional groups change throughout the ZooMSS simulation period.
}
\details{
Plot Time Series Data for ZooMSS Results

This function creates time series visualizations by:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Abundance}: Summing abundances across size classes, log-transformed y-axis
\item \strong{Biomass}: Calculating biomass (abundance Ã— weight), with optional stacking and proportional scaling
\item \strong{Mortality}: Averaging predation mortality rates across size classes
\item \strong{Growth}: Averaging growth rates across size classes, log-transformed y-axis
}

All plots use species-specific colors and filter out zero values. Time series plots help identify:
\itemize{
\item Equilibration time for model runs
\item Seasonal or cyclical patterns in ecological metrics
\item Relative patterns between functional groups
\item Model stability and convergence behavior
}
}

\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model
results <- zoomss_model(input_params, Groups)

# Plot different metrics
abundance_plot <- plotTimeSeries(results, by = "abundance", transform = "log10")
biomass_plot <- plotTimeSeries(results, by = "biomass", transform = "log10")
mortality_plot <- plotTimeSeries(results, by = "mortality")

prop_plot <- plotTimeSeries(results, by = "biomass", type = "fill")

# Focus on specific species (works for all metrics)

                              species = c("OmniCopepods", "CarnCopepods"))
