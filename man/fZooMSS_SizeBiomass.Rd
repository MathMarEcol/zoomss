\title{Sum biomass across functional groups for each size class}
\usage{
fZooMSS_SizeBiomass(res, w)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{List of abundance matrices from ZooMSS output}

\item{w}{Vector of body weights for each size class (grams)}
}
\value{
List of vectors with total biomass per size class (grams wet weight)
}
\description{
Converts abundance to biomass and sums across all functional groups
to provide total biomass per size class per spatial cell.

\details{
Calculate Size-Class Biomass

This function provides size-class-level biomass by summing across
functional groups. Useful for analyzing community size structure and
comparing size spectrum patterns between locations.
