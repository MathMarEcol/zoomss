\description{
Creates simple synthetic environmental time series with optional seasonal
variation for testing ZooMSS model runs when real environmental data is not available.

\details{
Create Environmental Time Series

This function generates synthetic sea surface temperature and chlorophyll
time series that can be used for testing ZooMSS model behavior. The function can
create either static environmental conditions or seasonal cycles with sinusoidal
variation. This is particularly useful for:
\itemize{
\item Testing model sensitivity to environmental forcing
\item Creating idealized scenarios for model exploration
\item Generating data when real environmental data is unavailable
}

The seasonal option creates SST and chlorophyll cycles that are out of phase,
mimicking typical ocean patterns where chlorophyll peaks when SST is lower.

\examples{
# Create seasonal environmental data
env_data <- createEnviroData(
  n_years = 10,
  dt = 0.01,
  seasonal = TRUE
)

# Create static environmental conditions
static_data <- createEnviroData(
  n_years = 5,
  dt = 0.01,
  seasonal = FALSE,
  base_sst = 20,
  base_chl = 1.0
)
