\title{Collection of helper functions for analyzing ZooMSS model outputs}
\usage{
fZooMSS_SumSize(list_in)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_in}{List of abundance matrices (typically from multiple spatial cells)}
}
\value{
List of vectors with total abundance per functional group
}
\description{
This file contains utility functions for processing, analyzing, and
transforming ZooMSS model outputs for visualization and interpretation.

Sums abundance values across all size classes for each functional group,
providing total abundance per group.

ZooMSS Utility Functions for Analysis and Post-Processing

The utility functions in this file provide tools for:
\itemize{
\item Converting between abundance and biomass
\item Aggregating results across size classes or functional groups
\item Calculating ecological metrics (trophic levels, PPMR)
\item Processing environmental data for model input
\item Data format conversions for analysis workflows
}

These functions are essential for the ZooMSS analysis pipeline and help users
work with model outputs in different formats depending on their research needs.
Sum ZooMSS Output Across Size Bins

This function collapses the size dimension of ZooMSS output by summing
across all size classes. Useful for analyzing total abundance patterns without
size structure detail.

\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model
results <- fZooMSS_Model(input_params, Groups, SaveTimeSteps = FALSE)
total_abundances <- fZooMSS_SumSize(results$abundances)
}
