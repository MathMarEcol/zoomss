\title{Visualize abundance changes over time for each functional group}
\usage{
zPlot_AbundTimeSeries(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs with time series data}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing abundance time series by species
}
\description{
Creates time series plots showing how total abundance of each functional
group changes throughout the ZooMSS simulation period.
}
\details{
Plot Abundance Time Series

This function creates time series visualization by:
\itemize{
\item Summing abundances across all size classes for each functional group
\item Converting to long format for ggplot visualization
\item Plotting log-transformed abundance over time
\item Using species-specific colors and filtering out zero abundances
}

Time series plots help identify:
\itemize{
\item Equilibration time for model runs
\item Seasonal or cyclical patterns in abundance
\item Relative abundance patterns between functional groups
\item Model stability and convergence behavior
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model with SaveTimeSteps = TRUE
results <- zoomss_model(input_params, Groups, SaveTimeSteps = TRUE)
time_plot <- zPlot_AbundTimeSeries(results)
print(time_plot)
}
