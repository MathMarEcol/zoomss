\title{Visualize growth rate changes over time for each functional group}
\usage{
fZooMSS_Plot_GrowthTimeSeries(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs with time series data}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing growth rate time series by species
}
\description{
Creates time series plots showing how average growth rates of each functional
group change throughout the ZooMSS simulation period.
}
\details{
Plot Growth Rate Time Series

This function creates growth rate time series by:
\itemize{
\item Averaging growth rates across all size classes for each functional group
\item Converting to long format for ggplot visualization
\item Plotting log-transformed growth rates over time
\item Using species-specific colors and filtering out zero values
}

Growth rate time series help assess:
\itemize{
\item Environmental effects on organism growth
\item Seasonal patterns in productivity
\item Differences in growth potential between functional groups
\item Model response to changing environmental conditions
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model with SaveTimeSteps = TRUE
results <- fZooMSS_Model(input_params, Groups, SaveTimeSteps = TRUE)
growth_plot <- fZooMSS_Plot_GrowthTimeSeries(results)
print(growth_plot)
}
