\title{Sum abundances across all groups and size classes}
\usage{
fZooMSS_SumAll(list_in)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_in}{List of abundance matrices (typically from multiple spatial cells)}
}
\value{
Vector of total abundance values (one per spatial cell)
}
\description{
Calculates total abundance across all functional groups and size classes,
providing a single abundance value per spatial cell.

Sum All ZooMSS Output

This function provides the most aggregated view of ZooMSS output by
summing across both functional groups and size classes. Useful for comparing
total community abundance between locations or time periods.
